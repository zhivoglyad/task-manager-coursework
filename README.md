# Task Manager

A feature-rich Kanban-style task management application built as a university coursework project. Organize your work with drag-and-drop, track progress with interactive charts, and stay on top of deadlines.

## Features

- Kanban board with three columns: To Do, In Progress, Done
- Drag-and-drop to move and reorder tasks (powered by @dnd-kit)
- Create and edit tasks with title, description, priority, status, and deadline
- Real-time search with debounce (searches title and description)
- Filter by priority (Low / Medium / High)
- Sort by creation date, deadline, or priority
- Statistics dashboard with charts (pie, bar, trend line)
- Dark / Light theme toggle, persisted across sessions
- All data persisted in localStorage — works offline, no backend needed
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessible: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management

## Architecture Notes

**State management:** Zustand was chosen over Redux or Context API for its minimal boilerplate and built-in `persist` middleware. The store is split into two slices: `useTaskStore` for task data and `useFiltersStore` for UI filter state. Both are persisted to localStorage independently.

**Selectors pattern:** Pure functions in `selectors.ts` compute derived data (stats, filtered lists) from raw state. They are framework-agnostic and easy to unit-test. The `applyFilters` function in `useFilteredTasks.ts` follows the same pattern — extracted from the hook so it can be tested without React.

**Feature-based structure:** Code is organized by feature (`tasks/`, `stats/`, `theme/`) rather than by type (components/, hooks/). Each feature folder owns its components, store slice, and hooks.

## Testing

Tests are written with Vitest and Testing Library. 24 tests across 5 test files:

```bash
pnpm test:run
```

Coverage:
- `storage.test.ts` — localStorage utility functions
- `store.test.ts` — Zustand store actions and selectors
- `useFilteredTasks.test.ts` — filter, search, and sort logic
- `PriorityBadge.test.tsx` — component rendering
- `TaskCard.test.tsx` — user interactions (edit, delete)
